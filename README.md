# LocA. Locative-Audio toolkit
Make a position-aware audio-walk, GPS-soundscape, local tourist guide or urban game with these Pure Data patches and authoring tool using MobMuPlat on your phone.

Warning: Until Pure Data supports double-precision floats, this project is on hold. It kind of works, but the workarounds and quirks to make it work are getting too annoying, so I am waiting for Pd to be double precision ready.
